# IT-Business-Analysis---Capstone

## Improving AML Compliance at TD
IT Business Analysis Capstone Project at Conestoga College. In this project, we had to pick a Canadian company from a given list and then perform a variety of work to solve and improve business processes and simulating BA work. We were acting as consultants for TD.

Our company name was Insights Consulting. It was a team of 5 members where I was the Project Manager leading the entire project, assigning tasks and responsibilities, defining the roadmap,and ensuring the quality of our submissions.


## Contents

1. Competitive Analysis
Here is where we researched and identified that TD's performance in the market has been on the decline in the last two years but it still remains pretty strong.

We identified and stated company's mission and vision. We performed financial analysis and found out operational expenses, market cap,etc and created a visual along with an org chart. Then we did a SWOT analysis of the bank and their competitors.


2. Problem Statement Identification
TD stock was the most shorted stock in April 2023. We discovered it was due to various reasons such as investments in housing, acquisition of companies and a cancelled merger. This is when the US government ordered a regulatory probe into the AML practices at the bank. So became our problem statement - to improve AML compliance.

After the first two assignments we had an initial presentation where we presented our findings to the sponsor and what we had learned. We also wrote a status report and described current, future and transitional states.

3. RFI 

We created a list of 20 questions after careful research and sent the request for information form to the project sponsor.


4. AS IS Process

We defined the AS IS process to the best of our research and assumptions as to how the current AML processes might happen. The idea was that here we will use AI and Machine Learning based solutions to improve the compliance process. From the RFI and further researching the problem we had identified 3 key areas where we could use AI to provide a solution - Transaction monitoring, Regulatory reporting and Employee training.


5. Requirements
Based on the RFI and our own research we defined functional and non functional requirements for the solutions. We had to define 3 solutions out of which one would be status quo. So keeping them in mind, we wrote our requirements.


6. Solution Design
Apart from status quo, our two solutions were either an inhouse ai solution or to hire an external vendor. So we described and designed both the solutions in detail at high and low level. Conducted impact analysis.

7. Data Design
Here we identified our key data elements.

8. Solution Recommendation
Compared solutions against evaluation criteria, evaluated ROI and recommended solutions with respective risks. Defined implementation and testing strategy.


## Final presentation

Ensured team members were well prepared. We followed the time limit, kept our topics concise and impactful and delivered a successful presentation  


The deliverables were weekly submissions. The final report and final presentation is also present in this repo.
